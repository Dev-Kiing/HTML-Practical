    <h2>👀 A True and Unknown Fact About Me</h2>
    <p>
      In 2024, I almost ended my marriage because of tech. I was deeply rooted in fashion design and couldn’t understand why my wife wanted me to switch lanes. Her persuasion pushed me to the edge. I remember writing a breakup message and walking out — ready to give up on love just to avoid tech. But she didn’t give up on me. She came, apologized, and promised never to pressure me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Months later, I found myself thinking about that moment… and slowly, willingly, I stepped out of my comfort zone.

    <h2>🛤️ My Journey from Fashion to Tech</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>King-Solomon O. Atebefia</strong>. I was once a fashion designer with no plans of touching tech. But in 2024, I took the leap — and what a journey it’s been. My wife enrolled me at <a href="https://www.welupdigital.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Welup Digital Academy</strong></a> to study UI/UX Design. At first, I failed. I dropped out of my first 3-month bootcamp due to laziness and self-doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in 2025, I believed in myself enough to pay again. That second time, I came back stronger. This time, I amazed even my tutor. He often asked if he was really the one who taught me, because of how quickly I applied what I learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      From there, I didn’t stop. I signed up again — this time for Frontend Development. I wanted to design and build. In just three months, I’ve mastered Git, GitHub, command line, and VS Code. I’ve created real repositories, worked on group projects, and today, I’m writing my first web page to be launched on the internet — this very one.
    </p>
    <p>
      This transition wasn’t just professional. It was personal. It required me to grow emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Late nights, early mornings, self-discipline — and above all, the desire to make my wife proud and prove to myself I could do more.
